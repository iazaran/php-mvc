[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/9b13bf034af64123821121d191acfaff)](https://app.codacy.com/manual/eazaran/php-mvc?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=iazaran/php-mvc&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

> This project tries to cover most of PHP features in a simple MVC structure with minimum installed composer packages. Then developers can use packages for specific requirements. Please add your ideas in Discussions or report bugs in issues.

#### Run Web App:
- Create a MySQL DB and change credentials in `env.php`. Update other values like MEMCACHED... and MAIL...
- Ensure about your PHP version >= 8.0 and then run `composer install`
- Uncomment `// createTables();` in `src/routes` _(It will create tables related with migrations.php and then will comment `createTables();` automatically.)_
- Use command line to serve it on localhost:8080: `php -S localhost:8080 -t public/`

#### Use Ajax to send forms' data:
Consider a route for your form like `/blog/create`; now use `blog-create` as an ID for form, and `blog-create-submit` for submit button ID. All form's buttons need to have constant `form-button` class.

#### API samples
Ready to use PostMan collection for API side:
