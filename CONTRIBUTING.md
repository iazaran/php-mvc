# Contributing
I love your input! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. I actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs or functions, update the documentation.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!
